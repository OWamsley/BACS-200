    <p>Wealth Gap in America</p>
    <p>The wage gap between the rich and the poor has been growing for a very long time now.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>America’s top 10 percent on average make 9 time as much as the bottom 90%.</li>
        <li>An even more stark gap lies between the top 1 percent and the bottom 90%. On average, they earn 39 times more than the bottom 90%</li>
        <li> Lastly, the top .1% earn 196 times more than the bottom 90 percent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The rich get richer.</p>
    <p>The three richest men in America own more together than the bottom 50% of americans. Jeff Bezos’ total wealth is 114 billion dollars. Jeff Bezos spending 1.7 million dollars is like an average american spending just one dollar.</p>
    <p>The wealth gap is so staggering, it can be hard to comprehend the difference in wealth. </p>
